Who am I?

Hello! 👋 I'm **Mickole Klein Nulud (@semickolon)**

**https://semickolon.com**

- I'm the director (among many other roles) at Polychroma Games
<!-- pause -->
- I love computers. I was studying computer science at UP Diliman and stopped. That's how much I love computers.
<!-- pause -->
- I love keyboards.
- - No, not just any ordinary keyboard. **I 💓 ergonomic keyboards** and unconventional, crazy input devices.
- - I make them from scratch, both hardware and software. That's how much I love keyboards.
- - Shameless plug: I accept commissions for custom ergonomic keyboards if you want one of these 😊

Workshop Intro

# First, let's set some expectations
- You will not learn everything today.
<!-- pause -->
- - Game dev is a BIG multi-disciplinary creative field and an incredibly crazy human endeavor
<!-- pause -->
- - It's true. I'm not exaggerating. But in the end, it is VERY rewarding.
<!-- pause -->
- My main objective is to teach the fundamentals of Godot and how things are done *the Godot way*

1. I'll be starting with programming fundamentals for complete beginners *briefly*
1. Then we'll explore game development fundamentals
1. Then finally, Godot fundamentals, to make a simple but complete game

- Overall, my goal is to introduce you to game dev and Godot with basic fundamentals. The rest is up to you.

# Two (very very important) tips for beginner game devs

⚠️ Do not make your big dream game (just yet)

⚠️ Do not get stuck in tutorial hell

<!-- pause -->
Later, if we hopefully have time remaining, or even after the workshop, we can talk about more stuff like the game dev industry and ways you can get your game off the ground 😄

✨ **Let's begin!** ✨
